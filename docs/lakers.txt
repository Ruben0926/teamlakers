The Los Angeles Lakers initially viewed Goran Dragic as a free agent target but changed their mind when they fell in love with D'Angelo Russell.

The Lakers thought they could sign a frontcourt player in free agency.

"I didn’t think about it," said Dragic. "The Miami Heat came first and they offered a good deal. This was the right place for me and my family. It’s a winning culture here and they are doing an amazing job.”

The Heat re-signed Dragic to a five-year, $90 million contract.




`````````````Byron Scott Not Playing D'Angelo Russell In 4th Quarter Regardless Of Score

D'Angelo Russell sat out the entire fourth quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers' loss to the Miami Heat.

Russell played just 21 minutes in the game, the lowest of any of the team's starters.

Byron Scott explained that Russell didn't get back into the game because the Heat pulled away. But Scott hasn't been playing Russell in close games either.

"I’ve got to figure out what I’m doing wrong so I can correct it,” said Russell.

Russell said Scott hasn't explained what he's doing wrong.

Russell ranks 11th on the Lakers in fourth quarter minutes.


```````Kobe Bryant Insists He Won't Leave Lakers For Another NBA Team

Kobe Bryant isn't sure if he will retire after this current season, but he is confident he won't play for another NBA team.

"I've said it so many times. I'm here, I'm a Laker for life," Bryant said. "I'm not playing anywhere else, no matter what. It's just not going to happen. I bleed purple and gold, and that's just how it's going to be."

Phil Jackson said in September he believed Bryant might play beyond this season.

"I don't think it's his last year," Jackson said. "It sounds like it may be his last year as a Laker."

Said Bryant on Friday: "That's Phil baiting you [members of the media] like he always does. He's a master at it."


```````````````````Kobe Bryant Excused From Practice For Being 'Really Angry' With Himself

Kobe Bryant was given the day off from practice on Monday following his disappointing performance in Sunday's loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.

Byron Scott said Bryant was told to just come back on Tuesday since he was "really angry" with himself.

Bryant shot 3-for-15 from the floor and 2-for-8 on three-pointers.  

"I'm just playing like (expletive) right now. I'm getting the shots I want. I'm just not making them," said Bryant after the game.

Scott isn't worried about Bryant figuring it out.

"He’s going to get to the Kobe that we know. It’s just three games into the season."



`````````````````````Kobe Bryant: I'm The 200th Best Player In The NBA Right Now

Kobe Bryant was highly critical of himself following the Los Angeles Lakers' loss on Sunday to the Dallas Mavericks.

"I’m the 200th best player in the league right now. I freakin’ suck," said Bryant.

Bryant shot 3-for-15 from the floor and 2-for-8 on three-pointers. Bryant is now 13-for-36 on the season.

"I'm just playing like (expletive) right now. I'm getting the shots I want. I'm just not making them."


``````````````D'Angelo Russell: We've Got A Lot Of Players Trying To Do The Same Thing
OCT 31, 2015 4:21 PM

http://basketball.realgm.com/images/nba/4.2/wiretap/photos/2006/Russell_Dangelo_lal_151014.jpg

D'Angelo Russell has had a slower start to his NBA career than some of his fellow rookies, which he attributes to his situation with the Los Angeles Lakers.

"You can’t worry about their opportunity and what they’re doing with it. Everybody is in different positions. The rookies that are separating themselves are in great positions and are getting it quick. Some people just have a learning process. That’s what I’m doing."

Russell was the second overall pick in the draft.

"The opportunity [here] is just so slim because we’ve got a lot of great players," he said. "Specifically, we’ve got a lot of players trying to do the same thing. You’ve just got to figure out your niche to stay on the floor."

Kobe Bryant sees some parallels with his situation as a rookie and what Russell is facing.

"He’ll have more opportunities and more leeway to make mistakes," Bryant said. "When I came in with the Lakers, it was a team that, we had a lot of talent and everybody expected us to win a championship, and if I go in there and mess up, it’s like, 'strangle the kid.' You know what I mean? There’s a lot more pressure there."



```````````````````Metta World Peace Makes Lakers' Roster, Jabari Brown Waived
OCT 26, 2015 1:34 PM

The Los Angeles Lakers will waive Jabari Brown with Metta World Peace taking the final spot on their 15-man roster.

Brown averaged 6.0 points over 14.3 minutes per game in the preseason with a PER of 12.0.

World Peace had a PER of 4.9 in the preseason.

World Peace's return to the Lakers includes a long-term plan to transition into an assistant coach. World Peace has been a mentor for several young Lakers' players, including Julius Randle.


```````````````````Lakers rookie Larry Nance Jr. handles success, struggles


http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151112/SPORTS/151119840/AR/0/AR-151119840.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667

DALLAS — His motor stayed running, even when Lakers rookie forward Larry Nance Jr. initially sat on the bench.

His aggressiveness stayed high, even when Nance Jr. broke his nose after Julius Randle accidentally elbowed him in practice. His sense of humor stayed intact, even when Nance Jr. forgot his hotel room number when the Lakers stayed in New York amid their weeklong trip.

Through it all, Nance Jr. has emerged as a promising development amid the otherwise sour start to the Lakers season. They are 1-7 entering Friday’s game against the Dallas Mavericks (4-4) at American Airlines Center. After sitting the first four games, Nance Jr. has averaged 6.8 points on 70.6 percent shooting and 4.3 rebounds in 18.3 minutes in the past four road contests.

All of which led Nance Jr. to provide more laughs instead of rookie platitudes.

“If there was one place I would’ve liked to play my first couple of games, it would’ve been at Staples Center,” Nance Jr. said. “I made sure I gave [Byron Scott] a piece of my mind about that.”

Nance Jr. was joking, of course. Beyond his expected energy and leaping ability, Nance Jr. has also emerged with a dependable jumper. Nance Jr. made all six of his shot attempts in Wednesday’s loss in Orlando, including his first career 3-pointer.

“I love the energy he plays with and I love the calmness he plays with,” Scott said. “He’s starting to feel confident that he can shoot it.”

Nance Jr. attributed his quick growth to making between 250 to 300 jump shots a day and starring for all four years at University of Wyoming.

“I’m not taking anything away from the young guys to the guys that come out early. Obviously you can look around the league and you can look around our locker room,” said Nance Jr., whom the Lakers selected 27th overall. “But I think we’ve grown up mentally and may be a little bit more ready physically.”

Still, Nance Jr. has learned some things.

In a recent game, Lakers forward Metta World Peace told him to run back on defense instead of trying to find a lost contact. World Peace said something similar after Nance Jr. absorbed more contact on his broken nose.

“I was out of it,” Nance Jr. said. But World Peace told him, “We have a game to play. Snap out of it.”

Nance Jr. apparently forgot in last week’s win in Brooklyn about taking credit for Roy Hibbert’s foul.

“He said, ‘You have to raise your hand and say it’s on you,’” Nance Jr. recalled Hibbert said. “I can’t have that foul.”

Nance Jr. also does not sound too enthused about Lakers’ strength and conditioning coach Tim DiFrancseo insistence on grass-fed foods.

“He’s got some peanut butter bars I like,” said Nance Jr., who’s used to eating Ramen Noodles and Burger King. “But I’m not eating salad.”

Nance. Jr’s appetite for defense, though, is a different story.

“I try to key in on getting every defensive rebound,” Nance Jr. said. “My main goal is the man I’m guarding doesn’t score. For the most part, I’m very happy with that.”
